CodeX
=====

*CodeX* generates beautiful code documentation from comments in your source code.


*CodeX* is developed in a combination of C#, MSBuild and XSLT 2.0.  [XMLPrime][1] is used in order to perform the XSLT2 transformations, and so a copy is currently required in order to build the documentation.  The evaluation version of XQSharp is sufficient to evaluate *CodeX*.

The first official release of the product will be able to produce MSDN style documentation from XML code documentation tags (`///`) in C# projects (a la Sandcastle).  Configuration of the documentation will be performed Custom Visual Studio project type.

The main goals of this project are to be:
 -  Beautiful.  The documentation produced should be clean.
 -  Easy to use.  You should be able to set up documentation for your product in 10 minutes.
 -  Configurable.
 -  Extensible.  It should be easy to add support for new themes, styles of documentation, languages etc, either with snippets of XSLT2, or through a .NET API.
 -  Integrated with Visual Studio.
 -  Fast.  Ideally it should be possible to edit code documentation interactively.
 -  Well documented :)


History
-------

The source code for this project originated as an internal tool which was developed to generate the [XmlPrime API documentation][2], and as a means for testing [XmlPrime][1] itself.  The source code has been kindly donated to me by CBCL.
